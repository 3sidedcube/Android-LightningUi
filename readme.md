#Storm Library - Module UI

Storm is a collection of libraries that helps make mobile and desktop applications easy to create using a high quality WYSIACATWYG editor.

This module's purpose is to take a structured collection of JSON files, parse them into POJO objects and render them to the UI using their respective corresponding views.

#Usage

##Gradle

Simply include the following for your gradle dependencies `com.cube:stormui:0.1.0`.

**Note** The versioning of the library will always be as follows:

`Major version.Minor version.Bug fix`

It is safe to use `+` in part of of the `Bug fix` version, but do not trust it 100%. Always use a *specific* version to prevent regression errors.
